## How to use

1) Open the menu (☰) → choose Flashcard or Sentence mode.  
2) Flashcard mode: tap a card to reveal pinyin/meaning, then grade (Again/Hard/Good/Easy). Spaced repetition will happen automatically as you go. Filter the words you want to see in the Settings.
3) Sentence mode: paste/type characters and write or trace each box.  
4) Toggle tracing mode for a light character watermark, and switch Simplified/Traditional display.  
5) Set left-handed layout if you hold the iPad/Pencil on the left.

## Install for Offline Use (recommended)

For the best tablet experience (no browser chrome, better fullscreen), add the site to your Home Screen. It is a progressive web app (PWA), so when added to the home screen it feels like a regular app and works offline.

**iPad (Safari):**

1. Tap the Share button (square with arrow).
2. Choose "Add to Home Screen".
3. Tap "Add".

**Android (Chrome):**

1. Tap the menu icon (three dots).
2. Choose "Add to Home screen" or "Install app".
3. Follow the prompts.

Note: Certain Apple Pencil hover features require Safari and recent iPad hardware (e.g., M2 iPad Pro + Apple Pencil 2).
