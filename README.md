## How to use

1) Open the menu (☰) → choose Flashcard or Sentence mode.  
2) Flashcard mode: tap a card to reveal pinyin/meaning, then grade (Again/Hard/Good/Easy). Queue orders itself with spaced repetition.  
3) Sentence mode: paste/type characters and trace each box.  
4) Toggle tracing mode for a light character watermark, and switch Simplified/Traditional display.  
5) Set left-handed layout if you hold the iPad/Pencil on the left.

## Tip — install on iPad (recommended)

For the best tablet experience (no browser chrome, better fullscreen), add the site to your iPad Home Screen from Safari.

1. Open the site in Safari on your iPad.
2. Tap the Share button (the square with an arrow).
3. Choose "Add to Home Screen".
4. In the add dialog, confirm the name and tap "Add". If an "Open as Web App" / "Open as App" option appears, keep it enabled so the site launches fullscreen.
5. Launch the app from your Home Screen.

Note: Pencil hover and some fullscreen behaviors require Safari and recent iPad hardware (e.g., M2 iPad Pro + Apple Pencil 2). PWAs or other browsers may behave differently.
